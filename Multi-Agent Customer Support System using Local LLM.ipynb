      "Okay, John, thank you for reaching out. I see you're trying to cancel your subscription but are encountering a billing issue, and your customer ID is 1. Let's address this step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Confirmation of Your Issue\n",
      "\n",
      "First, I want to acknowledge that you have two things we need to handle:\n",
      "*   You're looking to cancel your subscription.\n",
      "*   You're experiencing a billing issue preventing or complicating that cancellation.\n",
      "\n",
      "It sounds frustrating to have these two things happen together, especially since your account appears to have had some previous issues. We'll work to untangle this.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. Investigating the Billing Issue\n",
      "\n",
      "To help resolve the billing conflict, we'll need to look into why the system might be reporting a problem while you're trying to cancel. Here's what we typically investigate in this situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Payment Method:** We'll check the last used payment method associated with your account. Is it stored correctly? Is it expired or declined? (We might need to ask you to confirm or update this).\n",
      "*   **Recent Transactions:** We'll look at recent charges on your account, including any that might have failed or were attempted recently. This helps identify if there was an unexpected charge related to the cancellation process or a failed renewal attempt.\n",
      "*   **Subscription Status & Cancellation Fee:** Let's confirm the current status of your active subscription. When you initiate a cancellation, sometimes systems attempt to charge a final fee to cover any remaining portion of the billing cycle, or they look for a payment to process the cancellation immediately. We'll check if such a charge was attempted or is pending.\n",
      "*   **Billing Cycle Alignment:** We'll check how the cancellation date aligns with your billing cycle to determine if a pro-rated refund is applicable once the cancellation is confirmed.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Ticket Creation Recommendation\n",
      "\n",
      "You've already created several tickets (IDs 26, 28, 29, 30), including the one specifically for this issue (Ticket #30). Since these tickets are still open, I recommend **adding a note** to Ticket #30 (or whichever ticket best represents this combined issue) instead of creating a new one *now*. This keeps everything consolidated and easier to track.\n",
      "\n",
      "In your note, please provide any additional details you can about the billing problem itself. For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Are you seeing an error message?\n",
      "*   Do you know if you were charged recently?\n",
      "*   Did you try cancelling through the website/app and encounter a specific error?\n",
      "*   Do you know the status of your payment methods (e.g., credit card expiry, balance)?\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding this context to the existing ticket will give our support and billing teams the information they need to investigate effectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Refund Considerations\n",
      "\n",
      "The refund process is closely tied to the outcome of the billing investigation and the successful cancellation:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Cancellation Date:** The timing of the actual cancellation (once the billing issue is resolved) is crucial for determining the refund amount. Refunds are usually pro-rated based on the remaining days in the current billing period.\n",
      "*   **Billing Issue Resolution:** Resolving the billing issue is a prerequisite for a smooth cancellation and potential refund. If the issue was a failed payment, we need to ensure a valid method is available or that the system processes the cancellation correctly once the issue is cleared. If the issue is something else, we need to resolve that first.\n",
      "*   **Refund Policy:** Once the subscription is successfully cancelled and the billing system confirms no outstanding unpaid invoices or fees, we can initiate the refund according to our standard policy (typically pro-rated).\n",
      "\n",
      "## 5. Next Actions\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a quick plan moving forward:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Check Your Account:** Log in to your account dashboard (if you can) and review your payment methods and recent charges to see if you can identify any discrepancies yourself.\n",
      "2.  **Update Your Ticket:** Go ahead and add a detailed note to Ticket #30 (or the most relevant open ticket) with the specific error message (if any) and any other details about the billing problem. This is the most efficient way to move forward.\n",
      "3.  **Follow Up:** Our support team will review Ticket #30 and work with the billing team to investigate the issue. We'll update the ticket with our findings and the next steps.\n",
      "4.  **Our Action:** We'll coordinate with the billing team to look into the payment methods, transactions, and subscription status associated with your account (ID 1).\n",
      "\n",
      "Our priority is to resolve this for you quickly and efficiently. We understand you're trying to cancel and are facing a billing hurdle. Please add your details to Ticket #30, and we'll get started on the investigation immediately. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else we can assist you with regarding this ticket.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this notebook we:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configured a local LLM backend** using Ollama + DeepSeek  \n",
    "2. **Initialized three agents**:\n",
    "   - `CustomerDataAgent` (tool / DB access via `mcp_tools.py`)\n",
    "   - `SupportAgentLLM` (LLM-powered answer generation)\n",
    "   - `RouterAgentLLM` (scenario classification + orchestration)\n",
    "3. **Ran three multi-agent workflows**:\n",
    "   - Task allocation: looking up a specific customer and answering a generic question\n",
    "   - Negotiation / escalation: cancellation + billing conflict using customer history\n",
    "   - Multi-step coordination: reporting high-priority tickets for premium customers\n",
    "\n",
    "The router agent delegated work to the data agent and support agent, and the support agent used a local LLM (`deepseek-r1`) to generate natural language responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstrates a complete **multi-agent, LLM-backed customer support system** that runs fully **locally** without external APIs.\n"

      "Okay, John, I understand you're concerned about being charged twice. Let's address this.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Confirmation of the Issue:**\n",
      "You're right to point this out. We take billing accuracy very seriously, and it's concerning to hear about duplicate charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Billing Investigation Steps:**\n",
      "To resolve this, I will immediately start investigating your recent transactions. I'll:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   Review your account's billing history for the last few days to identify the duplicate charge(s).\n",
      "*   Check which service or product was associated with each charge.\n",
      "*   Look into your current payment method and subscription status to understand how the duplicate occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Ticket Creation Recommendation:**\n",
      "While I'll investigate this, I also recommend creating a support ticket for this specific issue so we have a dedicated record. This ensures nothing falls through the cracks, especially if we need to follow up. You can create a ticket [via the link/method, e.g., in your account portal or by replying to this email].\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Refund Considerations:**\n",
      "*   **Speed:** We aim to resolve billing errors quickly. Once we confirm the duplicate charge, initiating a refund is our priority.\n",
      "*   **Accuracy:** Before refunding, we need to verify the duplicate to ensure we're only refunding the incorrect amount and not affecting legitimate charges.\n",
      "*   **Account Status:** Since your account is currently disabled, please note that this might impact the refund process slightly, as we need to ensure the transaction context is correct before processing a refund.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Next Actions:**\n",
      "*   I will begin investigating your billing transaction immediately.\n",
      "*   I will contact you by the end of the business day (EOD) to provide an update on the investigation and the proposed resolution, including the refund.\n",
      "*   If you haven't already, please consider creating a support ticket detailing this specific duplicate charge issue for a separate track.\n",
