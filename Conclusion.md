Conclusion

This project demonstrates how a lightweight multi-agent setup can coordinate routing, data retrieval, and support response generation against a local SQLite-backed MCP toolchain, highlighting clear separation between orchestration and tool layers.

Key challenges include ensuring robust error handling between agents and MCP tools, maintaining reliable local LLM connectivity, and expanding test coverage; next steps could involve adding retry logic, richer analytics queries, and containerized deployment for easier reproducibility.
